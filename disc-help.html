      <h1>Why are some discs grayed out?</h1>
      <p>
        To avoid copyright issues, I can’t legally use some Minecraft discs with this extension. Mojang owns them,
        and they don’t make those files available online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The good news:</strong> if you already have Minecraft installed on your computer, those exact tracks are sitting on your own computer.
        We just need to show Chrome where they are. Look at the instructions below to get everything working.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        I get it — this extra setup step is annoying. But once you do it, you’ll have every disc working,
        and you’ll never have to touch it again.

      <h2>If Minecraft <strong>(Java Edition)</strong> is installed on your computer</h2>

      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the popup and click <strong>Use Local Minecraft Audio</strong>. A folder picker appears.</li>
        <li>Inside that picker press <strong>Ctrl + L</strong>, paste <code>%AppData%\\.minecraft</code>, and hit Enter.</li>
        <li>Highlight the <strong>assets</strong> folder (don’t drill inside) and click <strong>Select Folder</strong>.</li>
        <li>If it’s missing, enable <strong>View → Hidden items</strong> in File Explorer, then try again.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>macOS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the popup and click <strong>Use Local Minecraft Audio</strong>. When the picker opens, press <strong>Command ⌘ + Shift + G</strong>.</li>
        <li>Paste <code>~/Library/Application Support/minecraft</code> and press Enter.</li>
        <li>Select the <strong>assets</strong> folder (keep it closed) and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you can’t see it, press <strong>Command ⌘ + Shift + .</strong> once to reveal hidden folders.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Chrome might also ask for access to an <code>objects</code> folder and a JSON file in <code>indexes</code>.
        That’s normal — it’s just the extension reading your local music files.

      <h2>If you <strong>don't</strong> have Minecraft installed on your computer</h2>
      <p>
        No problem. The big <strong>Jukebox</strong> button still works — it’ll play a randomized mix of newer Minecraft tracks right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extension still has a lot of the other discs available. You can listen to many of them even without Minecraft installed. The new "Jukebox" feature will let you enjoy a <strong>newly added</strong> randomized mix of over 40 tracks from the game.
